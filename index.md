# Hey,

My name is <span markdown="1" class="highlight">**Arslaan Pathan**.</span>

I’m 12 years old and I like computer science, writing stories (sometimes), Linux, FOSS (Free Open-Source Software), hacking, reverse-engineering and iOS jailbreaking. My favorite genre of music is Hyperpop, particularly Hyperpop-Digicore & Hyperpop-Glitchcore. One of my best (and most recent) projects is a (currently unfinished) fighter game titled Showdown of the Sticks, inspired by Alan Becker’s upcoming game Animation VERSUS.

I mainly use riced MacOS on my M2 MacBook Pro with a custom tiling window manager setup, custom-mapped keyboard shortcuts and a custom menu bar (thanks to yabai, skhd, SketchyBar, and JankyBorders) for daily-driving and most development/coding. My favorite games are Minecraft and Stick Fight: The Game. I’ve been programming and tinkering with devices since the age of six. What originally got me into programming was looking at my old iPad 2 (which I still have as of 2025, six years later - it's now jailbroken with [EtasonJB](https://etasonjb.tihmstar.net/) because I felt like it) and saying – “how are these apps made?”

Feel free to explore my projects, stories, and achievements, and thanks for stopping by!
